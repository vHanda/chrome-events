A chrome extension to log all the events generated by chrome.

## Why?

I wanted to answer the following questions -

- How long did you spend at a particular website?
- How often do you switch between tabs?
- How often do you switch tabs because a website hasn't loaded?

The Browser's history did not provide enough data to accurately answer
these questions. This repo is an attempt at building a more comprehensive
database of browser behaviour which will allow me to answer these questions
and many similar future questions.

## Architecture

This comprises of 3 parts -

- Chrome extension which records all the chrome events. It does not log
  any actions performed by the user - No keyboard / mouse actions are logged.
  Only events which cause a tab / window's state to change are logged.

- A server where the data logged by the chrome extension can be sent. This server
  currently just writes the events to file in a json format.

- Analysis scripts which answer some of my questions.
